"398. Estimate the total number of chairs in the United States.
","Take your time, and ask questions to narrow down the choices. Is this just households (for example)? If yes, logically think through the steps: the US population is an estimated 307 million. Assuming there are about 112 million households out there, that works out to about 3 people per household (just under). The average house probably has a dining area and an office room. Assuming there are an average of 4 chairs total amongst both rooms, you can begin to estimate the """"household"""" demand for chairs by working backwards from there. 3 people x 4 chairs = 12 x 112M householders = 1,334M chairs
